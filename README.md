# levelz_dp_generator
Simple datapack generator for [LevelZ](https://github.com/Globox1997/LevelZ) minecraft mod

Version `0.1` contains main functional for datapack generation from `CLI` *(command-line interface)*

## Plans
1. Refactor some dirty information prints
2. Probably add a `GUI` in the future instead `CLI`
3. Process user input errors, move code with user input in self modules
4. Add `tags` section support
5. Add `achievements` section support
6. Add `crafting` section support

# P.s
Generator fully free for use and customization, but I would be happy to get any feedback to make sure the code was useful. 
Just click on the project star :)
